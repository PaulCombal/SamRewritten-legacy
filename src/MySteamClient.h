/**
 * Purpose: 
 * The SteamClient() accessor does not work. It always returns NULL for some reason.
 * We use the Steam Client library to call the CreateInterface to create an instance anyway.
 * 
 * This is used so we can communicate with the Steam Client without being marked as "In-Game"
 * 
 * I did not experiment a lot with this class, but I would advise to create only one instance for the whole program.
 * 
 * I get SteamApps to get owned games (if one AppId is subscribed)
 * I could use ISteamUser to get the current user's Steam ID. (what for idk, but later features maybe)
